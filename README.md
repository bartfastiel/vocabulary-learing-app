# Vocabulary Learning App

A modular web-based vocabulary trainer with multiple interaction modes (text, image, and audio).  
It uses native **Web Components** for full encapsulation — every component includes its own logic, markup, and styles.  
No frameworks, no build step, and no global utilities.  
Only one shared helper exists: `core/audio.js` for consistent sound playback.

---

## 🧭 Design Principles

- **Domain-oriented structure** — organized by functional area, not by file type.
- **Full encapsulation** — each component (`question-*`, `answer-*`) includes its own HTML, CSS, and JS.
- **No global utilities or stylesheets** — every piece is self-contained except for `core/audio.js`.
- **Deterministic imports** — all modules are declared at the top of `vocab.js`; no dynamic imports.
- **Readable mode naming** — each mode name expresses both question and answer type: `mode-<questionFormat>-to-<answerFormat>`<br>Example: `mode-wordGerman-to-choosewordenglish` → “Show German word → choose English word”.
- **Composability** — modes are built from reusable question and answer components.
- **Predictability** — all possible combinations and available component types are declared explicitly in `vocab.js`.

## 🧱 Responsibilities by File

### **index.html**
- Minimal root HTML page.
- Loads `<app-shell>` from `core/app-shell.js`.
- Defines no styles or logic itself.

### **core/app-shell.js**
- Root container for the application.
- Mounts `<vocab-trainer>` or `<rocket-game>`.
- Provides top-level switching logic between trainer and game.

### **core/audio.js**
- The **only** shared helper.
- Provides:
```js
  playSound("ding" | "buzz");
  playVoice(wordEnglish);
```

* Handles consistent sound effect and text-to-speech playback.

### **vocab/vocab.js**

* The **central orchestrator** of the learning flow.
* Imports all question and answer components at the top (no dynamic loading).
* Defines:

    * all possible question types
    * all possible answer types
    * all valid question–answer combinations (modes)
* Randomly selects the next mode and vocabulary entry.
* Creates the corresponding question and answer elements.
* Listens for `answered` events and updates scores through `points.js`.
* Integrates with `core/audio.js` for feedback sounds.

### **vocab/points.js**

* Handles:

    * localStorage for points, streak, and highscore
    * score updates and reset logic
    * streak record tracking
* Exposes simple methods for increment/decrement and retrieval.

### **vocab/question/** components

Each defines one prompt type and encapsulates its visual and logical behavior.

| Component                        | Responsibility                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `question-wordGerman.js`         | Shows the German word as text.                 |
| `question-wordEnglish.js`        | Shows the English word (for reverse learning). |
| `question-image.js`              | Displays an image as the prompt.               |
| `question-voiceEnglish.js`       | Plays an English voice clip.                   |
| `question-descriptionEnglish.js` | Shows an English descriptive hint.             |

All question components expose the word data via a `word` property and display their prompt immediately upon assignment.

### **vocab/answer/** components

Each defines an input or response method, encapsulated and self-contained.

| Component                             | Responsibility                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `answer-chooseWordEnglish.js`         | Multiple-choice with English text answers.       |
| `answer-chooseWordGerman.js`          | Reverse mode: choose German translation.         |
| `answer-chooseImage.js`               | Multiple-choice with images.                     |
| `answer-chooseVoiceEnglish.js`        | Choose between voice clips.                      |
| `answer-typeWordEnglish.js`           | Text input to type the English word.             |
| `answer-fillMissingLettersEnglish.js` | Fill missing letters of the English word.        |
| `answer-speakWordEnglish.js`          | Speak the English word aloud (future extension). |

Each emits an `answered` event:

```js
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("answered", {
  bubbles: true,
  detail: { correct: true/false }
}));
```

### **game/** domain

Self-contained mini-game unrelated to vocab logic.

* `rocket-game.js` — main game loop, controls, and rendering.
* `rocket-hud.js` — HUD with combo bars, counters, and coin stats.

---

## 🧠 Naming Conventions

### Mode structure

```
mode-<questionFormat>-to-<answerFormat>.js
```

* `questionFormat` = how the vocabulary is presented (e.g., `wordGerman`, `image`, `voiceEnglish`)
* `answerFormat` = how the learner responds (e.g., `chooseWordEnglish`, `typeWordEnglish`)

### Example meanings

| File name                                         | Reads as                                     | Meaning                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `mode-wordGerman-to-chooseWordEnglish.js`         | “Show German word → choose English word”     | direct translation      |
| `mode-image-to-chooseWordEnglish.js`              | “Show image → choose English word”           | visual recognition      |
| `mode-voiceEnglish-to-chooseWordEnglish.js`       | “Play audio → choose English word”           | listening comprehension |
| `mode-wordGerman-to-typeWordEnglish.js`           | “Show German → type English word”            | recall typing           |
| `mode-wordEnglish-to-chooseWordGerman.js`         | “Show English → choose German”               | reverse direction       |
| `mode-wordGerman-to-fillMissingLettersEnglish.js` | “Show German → fill missing English letters” | spelling practice       |

All question and answer files use this shared convention.

## 🧰 Technologies

* **Native Web Components**
* **Shadow DOM** for style isolation
* **ES Modules** (no bundler)
* **LocalStorage** for persistent scoring
* **Audio playback** via HTMLAudioElement and OpenAI TTS-generated assets

---

## 🧩 Priorities & Philosophy

* Zero external dependencies
* Maximum readability and maintainability
* Predictable and explicit control flow
* Extendable via new question/answer modules
* Minimal global scope — each component is its own island
* Reusable building blocks for future learning modules

---

## 🪙 Future Extensions

* Add new question/answer formats (e.g., `sentenceGerman`, `chooseSentenceEnglish`)
* Add speech-recognition support for `answer-speakWordEnglish.js`
* Add progression tracking and vocabulary grouping
* Extend `points.js` for leaderboards or cloud sync
